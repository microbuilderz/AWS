# AWS Cloud Practitioner
## AWS **Acceptable Use Policy** 

The Acceptable Use Policy describes prohibited uses of the web services offered by Amazon Web Services, Inc. and its affiliates (the “Services”) and the website located at http://aws.amazon.com (the “AWS Site”). 
This policy is present at [aup](https://aws.amazon.com/aup/) and is updated on a need basis by AWS.
- No illegal, harmfull or Offensive User or content
- No security violations.
- No Network, e-Mail or Message absue

## Types of cloud computing

- IaaS : Virtualisation, Servers, Storage and Networking is managed by the cloud company (example EC2)
- PaaS : IaaS + OS + MiddleWare + Runtime is managed by the cloud company (example Elastik bean stalk)
- SaaS : eveything is managed by the cloud company (example Rekognition)
## Pricing fundamentals

- For compute -> pay for compute time
- For Storage -> pay for data stored in the cloud
- Network -> Data transfer out of the cloud (**data transfer in is free**)

## AWS Identity and access management ([IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)) 

It is a **global service**.
Root users **should not be used** or shared.
Users and groups should be created. groups only **contains users**.
Users and groups can be assigned json documents called **policies**.Policies defines permissions.
In AWS the **least privilege principle** should be used.
Following **best practice**, groups should be created.
IAM Password Policies can be setup & Multi factor authentication.
MFA = password+ security device. the account will not be compromised if the password is lost.
MFA options : 
- **Virtual MFA device** ( google authenticator for mobile or Authy for multi devices)
- **U2F** : usb physical device
- **Hardware Key Fab** MFA & Hard Key Fab MFA for AWS govCloud(US).
### IAM Roles

Some AWS services needs access on the users behalf. Example give permission to EC2 instances, Lambda or cloudFomation.
They grant permissions to trusted entities.
### IAM Security tools :

- IAM **credential report** (Account level) : it lists all users and credential reports
- IAM **access advisor** (User level) : it shows the service permissions granted to a user and last access time.  
### Acessing AWS account

- AWS management console using password and MFA. (AWS Internet site)
- AWS command line User interface (CLI) using access keys. ( CLI can be installed on multiple OS)
- AWS SDK (used when you write code) by using access keys. ( Software developper Kit )

Acess Keys ID = username
Secret Acess Keys = password
### IAM Best practices

- do not use root account only for AWS setup account.
- one physical user = one user.
- assign users to group
- user strong password policies
- use MFA
- create roles for applications.
- use access keys for programmatic access
- use IAM **credential report** and IAM **access advisor** to audit user access.

## [Cloud Computing](../TechnicalProfessional/AWS-core.md#cloud-) 
## Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2)

It is an IaaS.

### [EC2 Instance](../TechnicalProfessional/AWS-core.md#aws-compute-services)
### [EC2 Instance Benefits](../TechnicalProfessional/AWS-core.md#aws-ec2-benefits-)
### [EC2 Instance Types](../TechnicalProfessional/AWS-core.md#aws-ec2-instance-types--)
### EC2 Security groups

They are **active firewalls** on EC2 instances
Control the traffic into and outo EC2 instances.
They have rules by ip or by security groups.
They can be attached to multiple instances.

### EC2 **user data**

Script launched at the first start of instance

### EC2 instance connect

Browser based ssh connection.

### EC2 Pricing

+ **on Demand** :

    On-Demand Instances are ideal for **short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be interrupted**. No upfront costs or minimum contracts apply. The instances run continuously until stopped, and customers pay for only the compute time they use.
    
    On-Demand Instances **are not recommended** for workloads that last a year or longer because these workloads can experience **greater cost savings using Reserved Instances**.

+ **EC2 Saving plans** ( Contract based)

    AWS offers Savings Plans for several compute services, including Amazon EC2. Amazon EC2 Savings Plans enable you to reduce your compute costs by committing to a **consistent amount of compute usage for a 1-year or 3-year term**. This term commitment results in **savings of up to 72% over On-Demand costs**.

+ **Reserved Instances**

    Reserved Instances are a **billing discount** applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. Customers can purchase Standard Reserved and Convertible Reserved Instances for a 1-year or 3-year term, and Scheduled Reserved Instances for a 1-year term. **Customers realize greater cost savings with the 3-year option**.

    + **convertible** reserved instance : change the EC2 instance type 54% discount
    + **scheduled reserved instances** : launched withtin a timeslot.
    

+ **Scheduled Reserved Instances** 

    Scheduled Reserved Instances (Scheduled Instances) enable you to purchase capacity reservations that recur on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, with a specified start time and duration, for a one-year term. Scheduled Instances are a good choice for workloads that do not run continuously, but do run on a regular schedule

+ **Spot Instances** ( No need for contract)

    Spot Instances are ideal for workloads with flexible start and end times, or that can withstand interruptions. Spot Instances use unused Amazon EC2 computing capacity and offer you **cost savings at up to 90% off of On-Demand prices**. They may be interrupted with a 2 min Warning in advance.

+ **Dedicated Hosts**

    Dedicated Hosts are **physical servers** with Amazon EC2 instance capacity that is fully dedicated to your Customers. **They are the most expensive**. Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2.
    **3 years allocation time**.

+ **dedicated Instances**

    like dedicated Hosts, but no access to the hardware. hardware will no be shared.

## [EC2 Storage](../TechnicalProfessional/AWS-core.md#storage-services-)

### Amazon Machine Images (AMI) 

are a custimization of EC2 instances.

### EBS Storage

EBS storage is a network drive , One EBS volume can be attached to a single instance.
Are locked to one AZ. EBS volume are persistant. only same AZ instances cann attach to EBS.
to transfer EBS volume data across regions, we can use snapshot to restore it in another region or AZ.
### Instance Storage

Hardware disk storage. Better IO performance. They loose their storage when detached. They are good for buffer/ cache / temporary content.

### EFS storage

can be mounted to 100s of EC2. shared EFS. works across multiple AZ. expensive. it is scalable.

## Elastic Load Balancer & Auto scaling group

## Elastic Load Balancer
managed Load balancer across multiple AZ. It supports health checks.

- Application LB : HTTP/HTTPs layer 7
- Network LB : ultra high perfromance , TCP layer 4
- Classic LB : layer 4 and layer 7.

## Auto Scaling Group

create or removes instances depending on demands or instance health across AZ. it can be used with elastic load balancer.
they are defined by minimun size, desired capacity, and a maximum size.

+ **AWS Cost Explorer**

    It can analyze your Amazon EC2 usage over the past 7, 30, or 60 days. AWS Cost Explorer also provides customized recommendations for Savings Plans.

### [EC2 Scaling](../TechnicalProfessional/AWS-core.md#scalable-architecture-)

- When Customers create an Auto Scaling group, Customers can set the minimum number of Amazon EC2 instances. The minimum capacity is the number of Amazon EC2 instances that launch immediately after Customers created the Auto Scaling group. 
- Customers can set a desired capacity
- Custumers sets a maximum capacity for peak workloads or capacity.

### [EC2 Load Balancer](../TechnicalProfessional/AWS-core.md#aws-compute-services)

### Messaging and Queuing

+   **Amazon Simple Notification Service** (Amazon SNS)
     
     It is a **publish/subscribe service**. Using Amazon SNS topics, a publisher publishes messages to subscribers.
     eMails/Push Notifications/text messages/ https requests.
    
     ![sns](../images/sns.jpg)

+   **Amazon Simple Queue Service** (Amazon SQS)

     Using Amazon SQS, Customers can send, store, and receive messages between software components, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available. In Amazon SQS, an application sends messages into a queue. A Customer or service retrieves a message from the queue, processes it, and then deletes it from the queue.
    

### [EC2 Compute](../TechnicalProfessional/AWS-core.md#compute-services-ec2)
### [Amazon Orchestration Tools](../TechnicalProfessional/AWS-core.md#aws-compute-services)

+ **Amazon ECS** : Elastic Container service.
    It is a highly scalable, high-performance container management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances
+ **Amazon EKS** : Elastic Kubernetes service
+ **Amazon Elastic Container Registry** (ECR) can be used to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images. Amazon ECR eliminates the need to operate your container repositories. You can then pull your docker images from ECR and run those on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS).
+ **Amazon FarGate**
