# AWS Cloud Practitioner
## AWS **Acceptable Use Policy** 

The Acceptable Use Policy describes prohibited uses of the web services offered by Amazon Web Services, Inc. and its affiliates (the “Services”) and the website located at http://aws.amazon.com (the “AWS Site”). 
This policy is present at [aup](https://aws.amazon.com/aup/) and is updated on a need basis by AWS.
- No illegal, harmfull or Offensive User or content
- No security violations.
- No Network, e-Mail or Message absue

## Types of cloud computing

- IaaS : Virtualisation, Servers, Storage and Networking is managed by the cloud company (example EC2)
- PaaS : IaaS + OS + MiddleWare + Runtime is managed by the cloud company (example Elastik bean stalk)
- SaaS : eveything is managed by the cloud company (example Rekognition)
## Pricing fundamentals

- For compute -> pay for compute time
- For Storage -> pay for data stored in the cloud
- Network -> Data transfer out of the cloud (**data transfer in is free**)

## AWS Identity and access management ([IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)) 

It is a **global service**.
Root users **should not be used** or shared.
Users and groups should be created. groups only **contains users**.
Users and groups can be assigned json documents called **policies**.Policies defines permissions.
In AWS the **least privilege principle** should be used.
Following **best practice**, groups should be created.
IAM Password Policies can be setup & Multi factor authentication.
MFA = password+ security device. the account will not be compromised if the password is lost.
MFA options : 
- **Virtual MFA device** ( google authenticator for mobile or Authy for multi devices)
- **U2F** : usb physical device
- **Hardware Key Fab** MFA & Hard Key Fab MFA for AWS govCloud(US).
### IAM Roles

Some AWS services needs access on the users behalf. Example give permission to EC2 instances, Lambda or cloudFomation.
They grant permissions to trusted entities.
### IAM Security tools :

- IAM **credential report** (Account level) : it lists all users and credential reports
- IAM **access advisor** (User level) : it shows the service permissions granted to a specific user and last access time.  
### Acessing AWS account

- AWS management console using password and MFA. (AWS Internet site)
- AWS command line User interface (CLI) using access keys. ( CLI can be installed on multiple OS)
- AWS SDK (used when you write code) by using access keys. ( Software developper Kit )

Acess Keys ID = username
Secret Acess Keys = password
### IAM Best practices

- do not use root account only for AWS setup account.
- one physical user = one user.
- assign users to group
- user strong password policies
- use MFA
- create roles for applications.
- use access keys for programmatic access
- use IAM **credential report** and IAM **access advisor** to audit user access.

## [Cloud Computing](../TechnicalProfessional/AWS-core.md#cloud-) 
## [Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2)] (../TechnicalProfessional/AWS-core.md#compute-services-ec2)

It is an IaaS.

### [EC2 Instance](../TechnicalProfessional/AWS-core.md#aws-compute-services)
### [EC2 Instance Benefits](../TechnicalProfessional/AWS-core.md#aws-ec2-benefits-)
### [EC2 Instance Types](../TechnicalProfessional/AWS-core.md#aws-ec2-instance-types--)
### EC2 Security groups

They are **active firewalls** on EC2 instances
Control the traffic into and outo EC2 instances.
They have rules by ip or by security groups.
They can be attached to multiple instances.

### EC2 **user data**

Script launched at the first start of instance

### EC2 instance connect

Browser based ssh connection.

### EC2 Pricing

+ **on Demand** :

    On-Demand Instances are ideal for **short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be interrupted**. No upfront costs or minimum contracts apply. The instances run continuously until stopped, and customers pay for only the compute time they use.
    
    On-Demand Instances **are not recommended** for workloads that last a year or longer because these workloads can experience **greater cost savings using Reserved Instances**.

+ **EC2 Saving plans** ( Contract based)

    AWS offers Savings Plans for several compute services, including Amazon EC2. Amazon EC2 Savings Plans enable you to reduce your compute costs by committing to a **consistent amount of compute usage for a 1-year or 3-year term**. This term commitment results in **savings of up to 72% over On-Demand costs**.

+ **Reserved Instances**

    Reserved Instances are a **billing discount** applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. Customers can purchase Standard Reserved and Convertible Reserved Instances for a 1-year or 3-year term, and Scheduled Reserved Instances for a 1-year term. **Customers realize greater cost savings with the 3-year option**.

    + **convertible** reserved instance : change the EC2 instance type 54% discount
    + **scheduled reserved instances** : launched withtin a timeslot.
    

+ **Scheduled Reserved Instances** 

    Scheduled Reserved Instances (Scheduled Instances) enable you to purchase capacity reservations that recur on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, with a specified start time and duration, for a one-year term. Scheduled Instances are a good choice for workloads that do not run continuously, but do run on a regular schedule

+ **Spot Instances** ( No need for contract)

    Spot Instances are ideal for workloads with flexible start and end times, or that can withstand interruptions. Spot Instances use unused Amazon EC2 computing capacity and offer you **cost savings at up to 90% off of On-Demand prices**. They may be interrupted with a 2 min Warning in advance.

+ **Dedicated Hosts**

    Dedicated Hosts are **physical servers** with Amazon EC2 instance capacity that is fully dedicated to your Customers. **They are the most expensive**. Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2.
    **3 years allocation time**.

+ **Dedicated Instances**

    like dedicated Hosts, but no access to the hardware. hardware will no be shared.

+ **AWS Cost Explorer**

    It can analyze your Amazon EC2 usage over the past 7, 30, or 60 days. AWS Cost Explorer also provides customized recommendations for Savings Plans.

You can scale these resources up or down instantly to grow and shrink capacity as your business needs change.
- **Agility** refers to the ability to rapidly develop, test and launch software applications that drive business growth Another way to explain "Agility" - AWS provides a massive global cloud infrastructure that allows you to quickly innovate, experiment and iterate. Instead of waiting weeks or months for hardware, you can instantly deploy new applications. This ability is called Agility.
- **Reliability** - Refers to the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, by dynamically acquiring computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions.
- **Durability** - Refers to the ability of a system to assure data is stored and data remains consistently on the system as long as it is not changed by legitimate access, i.e. data should not get corrupt or disappear from the cloud because of a system malfunction.
- **Resiliency** - Describes the ability of a system to recover from a failure induced by the load (data or network), attacks, and failures (hardware, software, or network failures).
- **Region vs Global Services** : Most of the services that AWS offers are Region specific. But few services, by definition, need to be in a global scope because of the underlying service they offer. AWS IAM, Amazon CloudFront, Route 53 and WAF are some of the global services.
- **Amazon CloudFront** is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment.

- **Amazon S3** - Amazon S3 is a unique service in the sense that it follows a **global namespace but the buckets are regional**. You specify an AWS Region when you create your Amazon S3 bucket. **This is a regional service**.
- **Performance Efficiency** - Is the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
- **Access keys** are long-term credentials for an IAM user or the AWS account root user. You can use access keys to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI or AWS API (directly or using the AWS SDK). Access keys consist of **two parts**: an **access key ID** (for example, AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE) and a **secret access key** (for example, wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY). As a user name and password, you must use both the access key ID and secret access key together to authenticate your requests. Access Keys are secret, just like a password. You should never share them. **Access keys are not tied to the IAM role, IAM group, or AWS policy**.
- AWS **Personal Health Dashboard** provides alerts and remediation guidance when AWS is experiencing events that may impact you. With Personal Health Dashboard, alerts are triggered by changes in the health of your AWS resources, giving you event visibility, and guidance to help quickly diagnose and resolve issues.
- AWS **Service Health Dashboard** publishes most up-to-the-minute information on the status and availability of all AWS services in tabular form for all Regions that AWS is present in. You can check on this [page](https://status.aws.amazon.com/) any time to get current status information or subscribe to an RSS feed to be notified of interruptions to each service.
- The **[Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/the-5-pillars-of-the-aws-well-architected-framework/)** pillars :
   - **Reliability** - This design principle includes the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand (keep the systems available, plan for failure).
