# AWS Core Technologies :

## Cloud :

In contast with On-Premises IT, the user will access ressources ( apps/ database/ server / storage ... ) throught the internet. 

## Cloud computing :

It's an on demand delivery of compute power, database, storage,.. via the internet with pay as you go pricing.
    
## Advantage of cloud computing :
    
1. Variable expense : 
**only pay** for what the customer consumes **when they need to**.
2. Benefit from massive economy of scale : 
AWS achieves heigher economy of scale -> **lower pay as you go prices**.
3. guessing capacity : 
**Eliminates guessing on infrastructure capacity** needs, no idle ressouce waiting, ressources in cloud computing can **scale according to the demand**.
4. Speed and agility :
New IT ressources are available within minutes.
5. **Stop spending money** on running and maintaining infrastructure.
6. Deploy globally (multiple regions) in minutes.

> AWS offers a huge range of features and services to help customers achieve their goals.
        
#        
## AWS Global [Infrastructure](https://www.infrastructure.aws/)

-    ### AWS Regions:

        AWS cloud computing ressources are hosted in multiple locations called **AWS regions**. 
        Each region is **completly isolated** -> great fault tolerance and stability -> increased [resiliency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resilience_(network)). 
        
        > Ressources **are only viewable withtin the region**, no ressources are replicated automatically across regions.

        How to **choose a region?**:

        1. Compliance : requirements (exmaple country requirment)
        2. Proximity : close to customer (speed and latency)
        3. Feature availability : not all features are availble in all regions.
        4. Pricing : not same pricing for all regions. 

-    ### Availibility zone (AZ):

        Seperated geographic area with multiple isolated locations. All AZ are interconnected with high bandwidth low latency fully [redundent fiber](https://blog.ospinsight.com/the-importance-of-fiber-network-redundancy).
        
        A minimum of 2 AZ is available in each region.

        > Deploying on multiple AZ in the same region **improves availability**.
        > 
        > On Instance runs in One AZ.

- ### Points of Presence (POP):

   Edge locations and regional Edge cache servers are used by **Amazon CloudFront (global content delivery service)** to store cached data, video, apps and APS with low latency transfer speed closer to customers. It accelerate communication and content delivery.
  
- ### Amazon Outpost :
        
  AWS Outposts is a fully managed service that offers the same AWS infrastructure, AWS services, APIs, and tools to virtually any datacenter, co-location space, or on-premises facility for a truly consistent hybrid experience. AWS Outposts is ideal for workloads that require low latency access to on-premises systems, local data processing, data residency, and migration of applications with local system interdependencies.    

## AWS core categories :

AWS has infrustructure services in different catgeories : Compute, Storage, Database, Security, Management, Networking. Thus offering a **high degree of architecture flexebility**. Cutomers can power up Web & Mobile apps, Data processing and Warehousing, Storage and archiving.

#
## [Compute](https://aws.amazon.com/products/compute/) services 

They allow customers to Develop, Deploy, Run & scale workloads.
They are the compute building blocks and comes with a large variaty of hardware configurations. Their software are customizeable at launch trough **AMI**. Can be used with auto scaling and load balancers.

> ![image](../images/compute.jpg)
### AWS compute services

1. **Amazon EC2** : Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud.

    A web service that provides resizeable secure compute capacity in the cloud.

    > compute capacity refers to that functionality that is traditionally provided by on premises and virtual servers.

2. **Amazon EC2 [Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling/)**.

    Customer can maintain the health and availability of their applications by **setting triggers** to **automatically increase/decrease** the number of instances (horizontal scaling) as well as the hardware of the instance (vertiacal scaling)

    **automatically add/remove EC2 instances** to adapt to demand.
    
    - It can **monitor the health** of running instances. When an instance fails the health check it will get terminated and replaced by a new one. 

    - It also **automatically balance instances across zones**.

    - Ensure **Dynamic** and **Predictive Scaling**

3. **Amazon ELB** : [Elastic Load Balancing](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/).

    It increases **availability** and **fault tolerance** of apps.

    **Distributes** application traffic across **multiple targets** : EC2 instances, containers, IP adresses and lamda functions. in one or more availability zones.

    It is **scalable** and acts at the **region level** (distribute traffic across multiple AZ within a single region).

    The load balancer sends requests only to **healthy instances** which are configured by the customer.

    They can offload encryption and decryption so that instances only needs to focus on their main work.

    There are three types of load balancers :

    1. Application load balancer.(*For web apps with http and https*)
    2. Network load balancer.(*more resilient on traffic spikes*)
    3. Classic load balancer.(*previous generation load balancer for EC2 classic instances*)

4. **AWS Lambda**.

    Runs code without server management. It is referred as **serverless computing**. Codes are run withtin **milliseconds of an event**

5. **Amazon ECS** : Elastic Container service.

    Highly scalable, high performance container management service that **supports docker containers**. It allows easy running of apps on a **managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances**.
    Containers can be managed with API calls.

6. **Amazon EKS** : Elastic Kubernetes service ( Container service)

     Fully managed service that you can use to run Kubernetes on AWS. 

7. **AWS Fargate** (serverless) :

    It works with both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS.
    It is a serverless compute engine for containers. It works with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Fargate makes it easy for you to focus on building your applications. Fargate removes the need to provision and manage servers, lets you specify and pay for resources per application, and improves security through application isolation by design. Fargate allocates the right amount of compute, eliminating the need to choose instances and scale cluster capacity. You only pay for the resources required to run your containers, so there is no over-provisioning and paying for additional servers. Fargate runs each task or pod in its kernel providing the tasks and pods their own isolated compute environment. This enables your application to have workload isolation and improved security by design.

## **Pricing and support**

### AWS **Free Tier**

The AWS Free Tier enables you to begin using certain services without having to worry about incurring costs for the specified period.

Three types of offers are available: 

- Always Free
- 12 Months Free
- Trials

## AWS **pricing concept**

- Pay for usage (On Demand): 
    For each service, you pay for exactly the amount of resources that you actually use, without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing. 
- Pay less when Reserving:
    Some services offer reservation options that provide a significant discount compared to On-Demand Instance pricing.
- Pay less with volume-based discounts when using more:
    Some services offer tiered pricing, so the per-unit cost is incrementally lower with increased usage.

## AWS **Pricing Calculator**

The AWS Pricing Calculator lets explore AWS services and **create an estimate** for the cost of use cases on AWS. AWS estimates can be organized by groups that can be defined. A group can reflect how the company is organized, such as providing estimates by **cost center**.

exmaple : 

- AWS Lambda : It offers **1 Million free request per Month**. The lambda has a maximum execution time of 15 minutes, so it can be used to run this log backup process. 
- Amazon EC2 : can choose a Spot Instance that would provide  up to 90% cost savings while still meeting the availability requirements of your workload.
- Amazon S3 : 
    1. Customers only for only the **storage that they use**.
    2. Customers pay for **Requests and data retrievals**.
    3. There is **no cost to transfer** data between different **Amazon S3 buckets** or from **Amazon S3** to other services **within the same AWS Region**
    4. **Management and replication features are paid features**.

### **Billing Dashboard**

The AWS Billing & Cost Management dashboard is used to **pay AWS bills**, **monitor usage**, and **analyze and control** costs.

### **Consolidated billing**

## Migration and innovation

### AWS **Cloud Adoption Framework**
It guives guidance on who to loop on the framework.
There are Six core perspectives of the Cloud Adoption Framework.

- Business Perspective : focus on business capabilities
- People Perspective: focus on business capabilities
- Governance Perspective: focus on business capabilities
- Plattform Perspective: focus on technical capabilities
- Security Perspective: focus on technical capabilities
- Operation Perspective: focus on technical capabilities

### **Migration for strategies (6R)**

- Rehosting : also known as “lift-and-shift” involves moving applications without changes into the cloud. 
- Replatforming : “lift, tinker, and shift,” involves making a few cloud optimizations to realize a tangible benefit. Optimization is achieved without changing the core architecture of the application.
- Refactoring/re-architecting : Involves reimagining how an application is architected and developed by using cloud-native features
- Repurchasing : involves moving from a traditional license to a software-as-a-service model. 
- Retaining :  consists of keeping applications that are critical for the business in the source environment.
- Retiring : is the process of removing applications that are no longer needed.
